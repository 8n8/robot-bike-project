\title{Kalman filter}

\maketitle
\begin{quote}
This is a description of the Kalman filter used for smoothing out noisy readings from robot sensors.
\end{quote}
As the sensors read in the measurements, $\bm P$ and $\bm x$ are continually updated according to these equations: 
\begin{align}
\bm P_{k|k} = \bm P_{k|k-1} - \bm K_k \bm H_k \bm P_{k|k-1}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\bm x_{k|k} = \bm x_{k|k-1}+\bm K_k\bm y_k
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \bm P_{k|k-1} = \bm F_k \bm P_{k-1|k-1}\bm F_k^T+\bm Q_k
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \bm K_k=\bm P_{k|k-1} \bm H_k^T\bm S_k^{-1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \bm S_k=\bm R_k+\bm H_k\bm P_{k|k-1}\bm H_k^T
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \bm x_{k|k-1} = \bm F_k \bm x_{k-1|k-1} + \bm B_k\bm u_k
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \bm y_{k} = \bm z_k - \bm H_k\bm x_{k|k-1}
\end{align}
(see \cite{wpKalman}).  The variables that are not defined by equations 3 to 7 are described in Table \ref{variableDescriptions}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}\toprule
Name & Description \\ \midrule
$\bm{x}$ & The state of the system.  This is a vector containing all the parameters needed to describe the system. \\
$\bm{F}$ & A matrix that can be multiplied by $\bm{x}$ to predict its next value.  This matrix embodies knowledge about the system, such as physics laws. \\
$\bm{u}$ & This is a vector that contains the control inputs.  If the system was a car it might be the steering wheel angle and the accelerator pedal position. \\
$\bm{B}$ & This is a matrix that can be multiplied by the vector $\bm{u}$.  It embodies a prediction of how the control input $\bm{u}$ will affect the next state of the system. \\
$\bm{w}$ & This is the noise from the system.  It represents the random differences between the theoretical predictions of the system behaviour and the actual behaviour.  It is assumed to be Gaussian white noise with zero mean.\\
$\bm z$ & The measurement of the state of the system. \\
$\bm H$ & It converts the state vector into the observations vector. \\
$\bm v$ & The observational noise introduced by inaccuracies in the measurements.  It is assumed to be Gaussian white noise with zero mean. 
\\
$*_{n|m}$ & The estimate of the value of $*$ at time $n$ given the measurements up to and including time $m$.\\
$*_n$ & The value of $*$ at time $n$.\\
$\bm P$ & The error covariance matrix (see \ref{covarianceMatrix}).  This is a measure of how accurate the state estimate is.\\
$\bm Q$ & The covariance matrix (see Section \ref{covarianceMatrix}) of $\bm w$.\\
$\bm R$ & The covariance matrix (see Section \ref{covarianceMatrix}) of $\bm v$. \\
$k$ & The current time.\\ \bottomrule

\section{Covariance matrix} \label{covarianceMatrix}
The covariance matrix is a matrix whose element in the $i,j$ position is the covariance (see Section \ref{covariance}) between the $i$th and $j$th elements of a random vector (see Section \ref{randomVector}).
\section{Random vector} \label{randomVector}
A random vector is a vector whose components are random variables (see Section \ref{randomVariable}) on the same probability space (see Section \ref{probabilitySpace}) as each other \cite{wpRandomVector}.
\section{Probability space} \label{probabilitySpace}
A probability space is a model of a random experiment (see Section \ref{randomExperiment}).  It contains the sample space (see Section \ref{sampleSpace}), the event space (see Section \ref{eventSpace}) and a function that calculates the probability of each event \cite{wpProbabilitySpace}.
\section{Event space} \label{eventSpace}
An event space $B$ is a collection of events (see Section \ref{event}) that has three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item it contains the empty set
\item for every event it contains, it also contains the complement of the event
\item if $A_1, A_2, ...\in B$, then $\cup^\infty_{i=1}A_i\in B$.
\end{enumerate}
(This section is almost a quote from page 1 of reference \cite{shum}).
\section{Event} \label{event}
An event is a subset of the sample space (see Section \ref{sampleSpace}) of a random experiment (see Section \ref{randomExperiment}) \cite{shum}.
\section{Sample space} \label{sampleSpace}
The sample space of a random experiment (see Section \ref{randomExperiment}) is the set of all the sample points (see Section \ref{samplePoint}) of the experiment.
\section{Covariance} \label{covariance}
The covariance between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is
\[\text{cov}\left(X, Y\right) = E\left[\left(X-E[X]\right)\left(Y-E[Y]\right)\right]\]
(see reference \cite{wpCovariance}).
The notation $E[X]$ means the expectation of $X$ (see Section \ref{expectation}).
\section{Random variable} \label{randomVariable}
A random variable is a function that has a sample point (Section \ref{samplePoint}) as input and a real number as output \cite{randomVariable}.
\section{Sample point} \label{samplePoint}
A sample point is one of the possible outcomes of a random experiment (Section \ref{randomExperiment}). \cite{samplePoint}
\section{Expectation} \label{expectation}
``
\begin{quote}
Let $X$ be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes $x_1, x_2, ... , x_k$ occuring with probabilities $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$, respectively.  The \textbf{expectation} of $X$ is defined as
\[E[X] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + ... + x_kp_k.\]
\end{quote}
''
\cite{wpExpectedValue} 
(See Section \ref{randomVariable} for the definition of a random variable.)
\section{Random experiment} \label{randomExperiment}
``A random experiemnt is an experiment or a process for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.'' \cite{randomExperiment}
